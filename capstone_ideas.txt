Capstone ideas:

1. Beer Recommender based on geolocation and beer preference within Los Angeles
	a. Basis: http://www.recommend.beer/
	b. Datasets (mostly scraping): 
		i. Beer Advocate: https://www.beeradvocate.com/place/city/9/
			a. name
			b. address
			c. list of rated beers
				1. reviews of beers => nlp + metrics for recommendation
				2. scores
		ii. Beer Me:  https://beerme.com/index.php
		ii. Converting Address to lat, long: https://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html
		iii. Current Location (from browser):
			// In the browser
			navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
			  console.log(position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude);
			});
		iv. Backend for location data: https://postgis.net/
	c. Positives: I like beer and process is repeatable for other cities
	d. Negatives: Could be nightmare architecturally (steps not entirely clear)








2. Effect of Twitter Sentiment Analysis and the Financial Markets
	a. Basis: https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/insights/2016/twitter-data-and-the-financial-markets.html

		ii. Twitter Streaming API https://twittercommunity.com/t/get-tweets-with-a-specific-hashtag-from-any-user/62368/5
		iii. Realtime Stock lookup's: https://www.alphavantage.co/
			a. API KEY: 6KV54TWD19DZHC9V
		iv. Backend: Postgres with json typing
	c. Positives: Can be very interesting to see both historical AND realtime impact of twitter and financial markets, can turn into product
	d. Negatives: Problem space can very huge, may not have enough background in finance, db schema needs to be planned well in advance










3. Sentiment Analysis/Classification of lyrics by Musical Genres
